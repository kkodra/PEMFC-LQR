# Singular perturbation modeling and LQ control of PEMFC-FPS augmented model
Main features of the algorithms:

1. An augmented model has been created from a PEM fuel cell (PEMFC) and fuel processing system (FPS). 
2. Said model is then converted into its singularly perturbed (SP) equivalent.
3. Efficient algorithm based on the Schur transformation developed to obtain SP form
4. (TODO: COMPLETE) Demonstrate LQR controller design for individual sub-systems of the SP PEMFC-FPS augmented model and compare with full order. 

*WORK IN PROGRESS*
